# RimKeeper Take & Sahre Hemopacks 
![](About/Preview.png?raw=true)  

This mod is intended for colonists with hemogenic genes such as Sanguophages.

I'm creating this mod to solve the problem of storing hemopacks for vampires in our colony. In the base game, colonists can store food and medicine in them. I wanted to add automatic functionality that allows storing a certain number of hemopacks in the colonists' inventory. So he doesn't have to look for a drink when he's thirsty for blood. Especially in case of accidents or being away from stocks.

Pawn will look for hemopacks in the stocks and will try to share them with the other colony vampires.
	
This mod support hemopacks form : [Vanilla Races Expanded - Sanguophager](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2963116383).
