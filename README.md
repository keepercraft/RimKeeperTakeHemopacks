# RimKeeper Take & Sahre Hemopacks 
![](About/Preview.png?raw=true)  

This mod is intended for colonists who have hemogenic ganes such as Sanguophages.

I'm creating this mod to solve the problem of storing hemopacks for vampires in our colony. In base game colonist pawns can store food in there inventory and medicines. I wanted to add option, for store secific ammount of hemopacks. So pawn don't need go looking for drink, when was blood thirsty. Spesialy in case of incidents or away from the storage.

Pawn will be looking for hemopacks in stock and will try to share them with other vempire colonists.
