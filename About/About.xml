		This mod is intended for colonists who have hemogenic ganes such as Sanguophages.

		I'm creating this mod to solve the problem of storing hemopacks for vampires in our colony. In base game colonist pawns can store food in there inventory and medicines. I wanted to add option, for store secific ammount of hemopacks. So pawn don't need go looking for drink, when was blood thirsty. Spesialy in case of incidents or away from the storage.

		I'm creating this mod to solve the problem of storing hemopacks for vampires in our colony. In the base game, colonist pieces can store food and medicine in them. I wanted to add an option to store a certain number of hemopacks. So the pawn doesn't have to look for a drink when it's thirsty for blood. Especially for accidents or away from the stocks.

		Pawn will look for hemopacks in the stocks and will try to share them with the other vampire colonists.
